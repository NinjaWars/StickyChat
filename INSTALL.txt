To Install:

Copy all the files from "Files" to your web root.
Note: It MUST be the root of the domain! If you need to put it somewhere else,
please make a subdomain. eg:
/web/root/htdocs/ <-- Here
/web/root/htdocs/chat/ <-- Not Here


Create a database for it, then, import "MySql/sql.sql" into mysql.
Make a user in the users table with their level as 1 (This will allow that
user to use admin commands, so if you want more admins, set their level to 1)
Note: Make sure you use a md5 sum for your pass!


Edit "/web/root/htdocs/inc/sql.php" to include your database details.


Insert data into `config` in the database.

DONE!

Extras:


Add Commands:

My script allows you to add commands via the database. To do so, insert the PHP code into
the `cmds` table, please use the whole commands syantax in the name, because the help file
will display the name, so, for a command like /pm, you should have /pm [name] [msg], the
command parse only uses the first part, /pm. Then, in the code table, insert the PHP code.
Be sure to read the class files so you know the details of the tabels!
